Besides being a good source of vitamins and minerals,
it is known for its ability to aid weight loss and reduce insulin resistance.
For example, in a study in 91 people,
those who ate half a fresh grapefruit before meals lost 2.9 pounds
 (1.3 kg) more weight than those who didnâ€™t .
In the same study, the grapefruit group had a significant reduction
in insulin levels and reduced insulin resistance .
Also, eating grapefruit has been shown to reduce cholesterol
levels and help prevent kidney stones .
#Grapefruit is highly nutritious. Eating it may reduce insulin resistance,
cholesterol and help prevent kidney stones. Grapefruit may also be useful for weight loss."
